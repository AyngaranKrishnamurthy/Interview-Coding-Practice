A heap is a special type of binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used to implement priority queues and is efficient for operations like finding the maximum or minimum element.
There are two types of heaps:
    Max-Heap: In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children. The maximum value is at the root.
    Min-Heap: In a min-heap, the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children. The minimum value is at the root.
