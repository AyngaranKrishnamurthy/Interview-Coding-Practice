1. Define a class Node with object as the argument:
    a. Define init method with arguments = self, val,left, right
    b. Set self.args = args

2. Define a method called Binary Tree with list as the argument:
    a. Check is list does not exist or is empty, if true return None
    
    b. Assign root by calling Node class (Root will always be the first value of the list)
    c. Create a list called queue with root as a value
    d. Create an index with initial value 1, as value at index 0 of list is already set to root

    e. Set a condition while queue is not empty and index is less than length of list_name
    f. Assign variable current = queue.pop(0), which is root value
    
    g. Set condition that if the list item at current index exists then execute
    h. Set the left child of current node is the value at current index on the list
    i. Append the left child to the queue
    j. Increment index

    k. Set condition that if the list item at current index exists then execute
